**BeatRX** is an interactive, browser-based application for creating unique, procedural music inspired by the iconic sounds of 8-bit and keygen soundtracks. It's both an endless inspiration machine and a hands-on creative tool, designed for anyone from musicians seeking a creative spark to developers needing royalty-free background music.

All music generated by this application is dedicated to the **Public Domain (CC0)**, meaning you are free to use it in any of your projects, commercial or non-commercial, without attribution.

## ‚ú® Key Features

### Dual Creation Modes
*   üéµ **Random Mode:** Let the algorithm be your co-creator! Instantly generate coherent melodies and chord progressions based on music theory. Choose between a repeating 16-step `Loop` or a continuously evolving `Song`. Hit "Randomize Melody" anytime for a fresh idea.
*   ‚úçÔ∏è **Manual Mode:** Take full control with a classic 16-step sequencer. Click the grid to compose your own melodies, harmonies, and arpeggios, all accompanied by a steady drum beat.

### Musical Intelligence
*   The generator isn't just random; it understands scales (like C Major, G Major) and common chord progressions (`I-IV-V7-I`) to ensure the music it creates is always harmonious and melodic.

### Real-time Sound Control
*   **Tempo Slider:** Adjust the speed from a slow `60 BPM` to an energetic `240 BPM`.
*   **Waveform Selector:** Shape your sound by choosing between classic synth waveforms: `Sine`, `Square`, `Sawtooth`, and `Triangle`.
*   **Volume Control:** Adjust the master volume or mute the sound entirely.

### Live Visual Feedback
*   Watch your creation in real-time with an oscilloscope-style **Waveform Visualizer** that draws the sound waves as they're produced.

## üéØ Who Is This For?

*   **Musicians & Producers:** Break through creative blocks with an endless stream of new melodic ideas and starting points for your next track.
*   **Game Developers:** Quickly generate royalty-free, retro-style background music and loops for your games.
*   **Content Creators:** Need some unique, worry-free background music for your videos or streams? Generate it here.
*   **Hobbyists & Tinkerers:** Explore the fascinating intersection of code and music, and have fun creating cool tunes!

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

BeatRX is built with a modern web stack:
*   **React** & **TypeScript** for the user interface.
*   **Tone.js** for the powerful Web Audio engine and music theory tools.
*   **Tailwind CSS** for fast and responsive styling.
*   **Vite** as the development and build tool.
